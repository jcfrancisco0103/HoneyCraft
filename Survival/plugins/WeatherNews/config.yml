# Stepping allows time to be displayed in steps. This is useful if you
# wish to hide information from your players. The system will use the
# entry which is farthest away from current time the next weather 
# change in ingame Minecraft ticks. 24000 for example is 1 day. An
# entry consist of up to 3 entrys of minute, hour and day.
# Please note that there could be strange things happening if not
# all three are present!
# This isn't true if anything is made as in the default configuration.
# For the minute, hour and day entrys a zero means will not show and anything
# over 1 means divide thou x and multiply with x in integer (natural numbers).
