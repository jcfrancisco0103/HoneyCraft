# Here is where you define how notifications will work.
# For example, with DIAMOND_ORE:15, it will notify admins after a player mines 15 (or more) diamond blocks
blocks:
- DIAMOND_ORE:15
- EMERALD_ORE:5
- LAPIS_ORE:20
- QUARTZ_ORE:90
- REDSTONE_ORE:40
- GOLD_ORE:30
- IRON_ORE:90

# This will send you a message when you break a block with the block name.
#  It will be green if its counted by ajAntiXray, and red if its not.
block-debug: false

# These commands will be executed when a notification happens
commands-to-execute:
- 'ajecho &c{PLAYER} mined {COUNT} {ORE}s in the past {DELAY} minutes [remove/change this command in the config]'

# This is how long the interval is where it will count blocks

# Should we not count ores broken in worldguard regions with the check-for-xray flag set to false?

# The sound to play to admins when a notification pops up
# You can see sounds for your server version here: https://wiki.ajg0702.us/resources/

# Should we merge deepslate ores with non-deepslate ores?
# This would make it so if you only have DIAMOND_ORE above, then DEEPSLATE_DIAMOND_ORE would also count.
# For example, if a player mines a DEEPSLATE_DIAMOND_ORE with this enabled, then it will count as a DIAMOND_ORE
